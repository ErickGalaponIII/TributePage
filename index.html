    <h3 id="headline">Here's a time line of Elon Musk's life:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><p><strong>June 28, 1971</strong></p> - Elon was born in Pretoria, South Africa</li>
      <li>
          <p><strong>Co-Founders Zip2 Corp. 1933</strong></p> <p>- At 24-years-old Musk develops Zip2 with his brother Kimbal using $28,000 from their father. 
          The company generates online city guides for newspaper publishers.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Zip2 sells to Compaq for $307m. 1999</strong></p> <p>- The sale, in cash and stock options, bags 27-year-old Musk 7%, or $22m. 
          What do you do with that kind of money? You buy a McLaren F1, as seen in this archive interview with CNN.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>SpaceX lifts off Jun 2002</strong></p> <p>- Musk pockets $165m from the deal as Paypal's largest shareholder.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Musk becomes chair at Tesla Motors Feb 2004</strong></p> <p>- Musk joins the electric car company, 
          named after Serbian inventor and engineer Nikola Tesla. As chairman of the board, Musk leads the Tesla’s 
          first round of investment funding. Four years later he becomes CEO and product architect.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Tesla Model S is unveiled Mar 1 2009</strong></p> <p>- Tesla’s five door luxury electric hatchback launches with a 265-mile driving range and 
          fuel economy equivalent to 89 miles per gallon of petrol. Deliveries begin in June 2012, and by 2015 the Model S is ranked the world’s best-selling 
          plug-in electric car.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>A first for SpaceX Dec 8 2010</strong></p> <p>- Musk’s company becomes the first privately-owned enterprise to return a commercial spacecraft 
          from a low-Earth orbit. The Dragon spacecraft takes off from Cape Canaveral and orbits at 17,000 mph as the first flight in NASA’s Commercial Orbital 
          Transportation Services program. SpaceX spends almost $400m in the pursuit of the endeavour.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>SpaceX delivers to the ISS May 25 2012</strong></p> <p>- An unmanned Dragon spacecraft becomes the first private capsule to connect with the 
          International Space Station, delivering 1,000 pounds of supplies. The capsule lands off the coast of California six days later in a mission labelled a “grand slam” by Musk.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Hyperloop open sourced Aug 1 2013</strong></p> <p>- Working within SpaceX, Musk refocuses attention on an age-old idea: high-speed tube transport. 
          Dubbed Hyperloop, Musk proposes a 350 mile route between Los Angeles and San Francisco, reaching a top speed of 760 mph. But the entrepreneur open sources 
          the project for others to develop, releasing the Alpha plans online.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Musk invests in OpenAI Dec 11 2015</strong></p> <p>- Along with other tech influencers including Peter Thiel, Sam Altman, Jessica Livingston and Reid Hoffman, 
          Musk contributes towards $1b of investment in the artificial intelligence non-profit. Sir binabasa mo ba 'to? Musk, a noted critic of AI, has called it “our biggest existential threat,” 
          but OpenAI intends to develop the technology safely and share its research. Investing, Musk says, is his way “to keep an eye” on the industry’s development.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>The Falcon 9 lands Apr 8 2016</strong></p> <p>- SpaceX successfully lands its Falcon 9 on a drone ship at sea, after three failed attempts. 
          The success marks a new era of reusable rockets, potentially reducing the cost of spaceflight. Previously rockets, worth tens of millions of dollars apiece, 
          have been discarded after launch. The Falcon 9 is eventually used to send satellites in to space for firm Iridium.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>An engine destined for Mars Sept 25 2016</strong></p> <p>- SpaceX successfully tests the Raptor engine at a facility in McGregor, Texas. 
          The company hopes 42 of the engines combined will takes humans to Mars in the next 10 years, providing a safety net for the vehicle: 
          “You could lose multiple engines and continue the mission safely,” says Musk.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>The Boring Company Jan 2017</strong></p> <p>- Musk launched The Boring Company, a company devoted to boring and building tunnels in order to reduce street traffic. 
          He began with a test dig on the SpaceX property in Los Angeles</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Flinging a Tesla into space Feb 2018</strong></p> <p>- The company enjoyed another milestone moment with the successful test launch of the powerful Falcon Heavy rocket. 
          Armed with additional Falcon 9 boosters, the Falcon Heavy was designed to carry immense payloads into orbit and potentially serve as a vessel for deep space missions. 
          For the test launch, the Falcon Heavy was given a payload of Musk's cherry-red Tesla Roadster, equipped with cameras to "provide some epic views" for the vehicle's planned 
          orbit around the sun.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Starlink May 2019</strong></p> <p>- SpaceX launched the first batch of 60 satellites in May 2019, and followed with another payload of 60 satellites that November. 
          While this represented significant progress for the Starlink venture, the appearance of these bright orbiters in the night sky, with the potential of thousands more to come, 
          worried astronomers who felt that a proliferation of satellites would increase the difficulty of studying distant objects in space.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Richest person in the world Jan 7, 2021</strong></p> <p>- Elon Musk briefly became the richest person in the world, with a net worth of more than $185 billion because 
          of increase in Tesla’s share price. Musk’s wealth surge over the past year marks the fastest rise to the top of the rich list in history. As of January 31,2022, Musk is valued at 
          around $220 Billion dollars</p>
